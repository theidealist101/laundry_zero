Laundry Zero
============

A joke mod for the Minetest game Skyblock Zero which adds Detergent Pods which may be eaten or used to make machines more efficient.

Do not eat laundry detergent pods in real life, they are poisonous and can cause death.

Features
========

- Make a Detergent Pod by crafting an expensive Detergent Generator and then using Charged Particles on it.
- Detergent Pods can be used to clean nodes, making them faster for a while.
- With lots of cleaning you can make your machines go incredibly fast!
- Eat Detergent Pods to make yourself violently ill!!!
- If you're sick for too long, though, you'll get taken to hospital and have to find your way out again.
- Five new quests, including three secret ones that only appear when completed!
- Only mod made for Skyblock Zero so far! (lol)
